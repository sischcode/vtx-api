    DRAFT!
    ======

    pilots:
        - "pilot_name" attribute MUST be given
        - "craft_name" is optional at this point
        - at least one of [vtx_name, bands, preferred_bands, preferred_frequencies] MUST exist to determine available bands.
          If more exist, the most specific overrides the more unspecific, the order is:
          "preferred_frequencies > preferred_bands > [bands|vtx_name]". 
        - "preferred_frequencies" can be mixed between their band "id" (i.e. "R1" for Raceband 1) and the plain frequency.
        - If only the vtx_name is given, the call may fail, if said vtx is not available in the DB.
        - in the future, if a pilot would be registered with name and craft, it would also be possible to directly acces this information.
        - "polarization" is optional. If not set it defaults to RHCP

    options:
        - "optimizeBy" determines the method of optimization. defaults to "pilot_preference". (the other method would be "max_mhz_distance")
        - "min_mhz_spacing" determines the minimal spacing. defaults to 40
        - "num_results" determines how many results will be returned. defaults to "BEST" (i.e. best solution only). the other option is "MAX_TOP_10"
