# vtx-api
Small API to help FPV-Pilots find the best set of frequencies when flying together. Also useful to find out about VTXs, VTX-Frequencies and stuff.

notes: 
    - this is _very far_ from being anywhere near finished!
    - Even though, AVA is currently not used for testing I let the npm scripts and config reside in package.json...
